## ⚙️ How It Works

**Adding Employees**:

- Employees are added via the **Home Page**, where a form is provided to input details.
- Validation ensures all required fields are filled out.
- Upon submission, the employee is saved to `localStorage` and displayed in the **Employees List**.

**Viewing Employees**:

- The **Employees List** route displays all employees in a table.
- Users can sort the table by any column or filter employees via a search bar.

**Context and Local Storage**:

- The app uses `React Context` to manage the global state of employees.
- Employees are saved in `localStorage` to persist data between sessions.
